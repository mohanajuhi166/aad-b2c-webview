Azure AD B2C Embedded Webview
============================

Azure AD B2C Embedded Webview is a very simple Flutter package that demonstrates how to use the
embedded web view to sign in users with Azure AD B2C. Currently, using Flutter packages

- [appAuth](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_appauth)
  and [flutter_azure_b2c](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_azure_b2c) redirects to browser and
  doesn't provide in-app experience.

This package embeds the web view of the user flow endpoint
using [flutter_appview](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter) and redirects the user as per
onRedirect callback method.
